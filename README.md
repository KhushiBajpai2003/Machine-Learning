# MACHINE LEARNING PROJECTS

Welcome to the Machine Learning (ML) Repository! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and datasets covering various topics and algorithms in machine learning. Each notebook focuses on different aspects of ML, from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to the implementation of various ML algorithms.

# Introduction
This repository is designed to help you learn and implement different machine learning algorithms using Python and Jupyter notebooks. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced practitioner, you will find valuable resources to enhance your understanding and application of machine learning techniques.
